        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Abigail, but everyone calls me Abi! I am an Archaeology
          and History graduate from The University of Winchester. I have always
          had an interest in coding and started learning at the start of this
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like gardening, building LEGO and buying stationary. When I'm not
          coding you'll often find me reading, tending to my houseplants or lounging on the sofa watching Netflix.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been documenting my coding progress on my
